Tech. Stack: Ruby on Rails (Solidus Cart Functionality Gem), React.js, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, SOLR, AWS. 
* Converting Online Store to a Marketplace  
** Modified existing database schema to enable matching of products to their associated vendors and configured the Solr (search engine) to integrate this new entity-relation. 
** Refactored the entire existing products & images pipeline to facilitate processing of the new marketplace products. 
** Set up microservices and developed secure API’s (Pub-Sub data sync method) for vendors to update product attributes such as price and inventory on the systems.
* Designing Microservice Architecture (Linux, NodeJS, ExpressJS, ES6, BabelJS, PM2, Nginx, PostgreSQL, Memcached, AWS) 
** Integrated the AWS components (API Gateway, Load Balancers etc) to setup the microservice environment, and created functionally for automated deployment. 
** Scaled the main web application on Y-Axis and reduced the API response time for order placement by 200ms via moving the Messaging & Email Service to a microservice; this resulted in average response time of 50ms -- around 200ms faster compared to the previous average of 250ms. 
* Tech Infrastructure Scaling and Optimization 
** Modified the web-application’s assets (CSS, JS bundles) precompiling (e.g. Minifying) architecture: used MapReduce to parallelize the processing of mobile and desktop assets onto different servers. Also upgraded the compute capacity of all the processing servers which resulted in reduction of the overall precompile time by 50%.
** Scaled up the processing capacity of the images pipeline from processing 300 images per day to 600 using parallel Processing (MapReduce like concept)
